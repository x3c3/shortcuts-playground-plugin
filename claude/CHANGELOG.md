# Changelog

All notable changes to the Shortcuts Playground plugin are documented in this file. The skill-level changelog lives at `skills/shortcuts-playground/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [1.7.3] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed — Find Health Samples Type picker

- Corrected Find Health Samples sample-kind filters to use a non-removable `Property = Type` row with `Values.Enumeration.WFSerializationType = WFStringSubstitutableState`.
- Rejected the broken `Property = Value` / `Values.String = Step Count` shape that imports as an editable text filter instead of the Health type picker.
- Updated Claude Code and Codex docs, validators, generated reference metadata, and regression fixtures; `Step Count` now maps to `Steps` for Find Health Samples.

## [1.7.2] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed — Find Health Samples Value field

- Superseded by 1.7.3. This release incorrectly changed Find Health Samples sample-kind filters to `Property = Value`, which imported as an editable text filter.

## [1.7.1] — 2026-04-27

### Fixed — Find Health Samples Type filter

- Corrected both Claude Code and Codex packages so generated Find Health Samples actions no longer use obsolete top-level `WFHealthQuantityType`.
- Updated HealthKit docs and validator rules to require the Health sample kind inside `WFContentItemFilter`; 1.7.3 later corrected the value state to the locked `Type` enumeration shape.
- Added regression coverage for missing and unknown Health sample-kind filters.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added — Codex package and dual-runtime repository layout

- Moved the Claude Code plugin package into `claude/`.
- Added a Codex plugin package in `codex/` with `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, Codex skill metadata, direct script-based validation/signing, and converted PNG icon assets.
- Updated the root Claude marketplace to install from `./claude`.
- Added a root Codex marketplace at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` that points to `./codex`.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed — remove personal local evidence details from distributed references

- Removed user-specific export filenames, iCloud scratch-folder references, and local path details from HealthKit docs and generated reference data.
- Reframed HealthKit XML examples around generic evidence IDs and parameter shapes.
- Sanitized bundled golden XML examples that contained personal attribution or sample contact names.
- Kept generic placeholder paths such as `/Users/you/...` where docs need to demonstrate absolute path syntax.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added — HealthKit action support

- Added HealthKit reference data generated from the iPhoneOS 26.2 SDK and ActionKit Health unit constants.
- Added `skills/shortcuts-playground/HEALTHKIT.md` with bundled anonymized iOS XML examples for Find Health Samples, Get Details of Health Sample, Log Health Sample, and Log Workout.
- Updated the validator and regression suite so HealthKit sample types, detail properties, category enum values, workout activity types, units, filters, dates, and variables are checked structurally.
- Updated the plugin self-test to verify `healthkit-ios26.2-reference.json` is packaged.

### Verified

- `scripts/test_wiring_regressions.py` — HealthKit 527/527, location 40/40, set-name 12/12, weather 40/40.
- `bin/shortcuts-playground-selftest` — all checks passed, including the new HealthKit data file.

## [1.5.3] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed — validator false positives surfaced by external audit

Three independently-confirmed bugs in `skills/shortcuts-playground/scripts/validate_shortcut.py`. Each one has a behavioral test alongside the existing regression suite.

- **Allowlist pollution in `parse_actions_md`.** The old regex grabbed every first-column backticked cell in `ACTIONS.md`, so parameter-table rows like `` | `UUID` | String | … `` and `` | `Album` | String | Album name `` were being auto-prefixed and injected as `is.workflow.actions.UUID` / `is.workflow.actions.Album`. That silently allowed bogus identifiers through the unknown-action check. Parser is now section-aware: it only consumes rows inside tables whose first-column header is literally `Identifier`. Header rows for `Parameter`, `Property`, `Class Name`, etc. switch parsing back off. Verified: the two polluted entries are gone, and every legitimate action identifier the old parser produced is still present (the canonical allowlist still comes from `data/toolkit-v63-tool-ids.json` — `parse_actions_md` is additive).

- **`TOKEN_HINT_RE` too broad.** The old pattern `(api[\s_-]?key|token)` (case-insensitive, no word boundaries) matched the substring `token` inside benign filenames like `SP-043-tokenized.txt`, `tokenizer.csv`, or `brokentoken.json`, wrongly flagging any file-loading action referencing them as "API token loaded from file." Replaced with `\b(api[\s_-]?(key|token)|bearer[\s_-]?token|access[\s_-]?token|secret[\s_-]?(key|token)|auth[\s_-]?token)\b`. Verified with a 13-case truth table — all benign filenames pass, all real credential-shaped strings still match.

- **Manual-unit-conversion false positive on date formats.** `UNIT_KEYWORD_IGNORED_KEYS` listed `WFDateFormat` and `WFDateFormatString`, but inside a `WFDateFormatVariableAggrandizement` payload the plist key is literally `DateFormat` — not the `WF`-prefixed parameter key. The case-insensitive `\bmm\b` pattern then matched `MM` inside custom format strings like `yyyy-MM-dd`, triggering the "use measurement.convert" error on perfectly valid date-formatting shortcuts. Added `DateFormat` to the ignore set with a short comment explaining why both forms are needed. Sanity-verified: real unit text like "42 miles" still triggers the check.

### Improved — platform availability marked in `APPINTENTS.md`

Added a "Platform Availability" section at the top of `skills/shortcuts-playground/APPINTENTS.md` explaining that the bundled AppIntents catalog does not uniformly mark iOS-only vs macOS vs universal intents, and that the Shortcuts app will accept a platform-mismatched plist at validation time only to fail at runtime. Seeded the section with the first confirmed iOS-only intent — `com.apple.shortcuts.OpenShortcutsStaticDeepLinks` (Open Shortcuts Settings) — since the "Settings" pane only exists in the iOS Shortcuts app, not on macOS. Inline note in the two existing "Shortcuts (23 actions)" tables points readers back to the platform section. Table is expected to grow as more iOS-only intents surface during real-world use.

### Unchanged since v1.5.2

- Marketplace manifest layout, INSTALL.md, agent prompts, all `bin/` wrappers, hook behavior, and every other skill doc are unchanged. This release is scoped to the four items above.

### Verified

- **Self-test:** `bin/shortcuts-playground-selftest` — all checks pass (interpreter, `shortcuts` CLI, plugin root, bundled data files, embedded-golden validation, sign round-trip).
- **Regression suite:** `scripts/test_wiring_regressions.py` — 92/92 (weather 40/40, location 40/40, set-name 12/12).
- **Random mixed corpus:** `scripts/test_random_mixed_shortcuts.py` — 50/50 synthetic shortcuts pass with 18–21 distinct actions each.
- **Targeted fix tests:** three ad-hoc fixtures exercising the specific failure paths — filename `SP-043-tokenized.txt` no longer trips the token-file check; a `DateFormat: "yyyy-MM-dd"` inside `WFDateFormatVariableAggrandizement` no longer trips the unit-conversion check; parameter-column identifiers like `UUID` and `Album` no longer appear in the parsed allowlist.

### Deferred

Four remaining items from the audit were intentionally deferred rather than patched blind, because each needs a concrete failing shortcut to avoid over-correcting. Tracked for a follow-up: (a) `documentpicker.save` with empty `WFFileDestinationPath`; (b) Adjust Date with `CurrentDate` token attachments flagged as empty; (c) SP-028 comment-scanner false positive; (d) import-schema drift across Open App, multi-condition If, Translate Text, Find Photos Album, and Get Weather Detail. Open a repro before touching any of these.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-04-14

### Added — internal release packaging for the MacStories team

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** reinstated in the plugin repo. v1.2.0 had removed it for eventual Anthropic submission, but for the internal MacStories release the co-located manifest is the pragmatic choice: one GitHub URL, one `claude plugin marketplace add` call, one `claude plugin install` command. The marketplace entry points at `./` as the plugin source so the repo serves both roles (marketplace + plugin) from the same directory.
- **`INSTALL.md`** in the repo root. A single-page install guide for the team covering prerequisites (macOS, Claude Code, Python 3.10+, GitHub access), the two install commands, self-test verification, output directory configuration, day-to-day usage for build and remix, updating, uninstalling, and common troubleshooting paths. Written so a MacStories reader can install the plugin and generate their first shortcut in under five minutes.

### Unchanged since v1.5.1
- Agent prompts, validator logic, hook behavior, bin wrappers, skill content — all v1.5.1 as verified.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed — placeholder UUID generation (the known issue from v1.5.0)

Both agents were producing sequential-placeholder UUIDs (`11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`, `22222222-…`, through `AAAAAAAA-…`) instead of `uuidgen`-random values. Functionally valid (correct format, uppercase, unique within each file) but broke cross-shortcut uniqueness if users imported multiple shortcuts into the same library. Fixed in three places:

- **`agents/shortcut-builder.md` step 6** — rewritten from "Generate UUIDs. Every action that produces output needs a unique uppercase UUID" to an explicit `uuidgen` requirement with a concrete batch Bash example:
  ```bash
  for i in $(seq 1 <N>); do uuidgen | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'; done
  ```
  The agent mints all UUIDs upfront in one call and assigns them from the output list. Placeholder sequences are explicitly forbidden; the validator will reject them.

- **`agents/shortcut-remixer.md` step 6** — same `uuidgen` requirement, but scoped only to NEW actions being added in the diff. Existing real UUIDs in the source are preserved. The remixer may regenerate source UUIDs ONLY if they match the validator's repeating-hex pattern (which means they were already broken and must be migrated as part of the remix).

- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/SKILL.md` rule 1** — expanded from "UUIDs must be uppercase" to include the `uuidgen` requirement and a concrete example of a valid UUID shape (`7F3A4E91-C2D8-4B56-BE5A-0242AC120002`). Explicit callout that placeholder sequences will fail validation.

### Validator — new repeating-hex UUID check

`scripts/validate_shortcut.py` now scans the raw file text for the regex `\b([0-9A-F])\1{7}-\1{4}-\1{4}-\1{4}-\1{12}\b` — any UUID where every hex character is the same. Rejection is a hard error with a single consolidated message naming up to three offending UUIDs and telling the agent to re-mint via `uuidgen`. The check runs once per validation call, catching UUIDs in action parameters, `OutputUUID` references, `GroupingIdentifier` values, and anywhere else a placeholder could hide.

**Impact on existing shortcuts with placeholder UUIDs:** any shortcut generated by v1.5.0 or earlier that contains placeholder UUIDs will now fail validation. If you want to re-validate or remix such a shortcut, the remixer will detect the placeholders during step 7 (audit) and regenerate them consistently across all references — this is a one-time migration per source, preserving wiring while fixing the UUIDs.

### Verified

- **Positive:** `shortcuts-playground-selftest` still passes (the embedded golden uses `A1B2C3D4-E5F6-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890` — unique hex per position, not a repeating pattern).
- **Negative:** a crafted XML with `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` correctly fails validation with the new error message pointing the agent at `uuidgen`.
- **Regex round-trip:** validated against 5 test patterns — `11111111-…`, `AAAAAAAA-…`, `BBBBBBBB-…` all match; `A1B2C3D4-E5F6-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890` and `7F3A4E91-C2D8-4B56-BE5A-0242AC120002` (real uuidgen output shape) correctly do NOT match.
- **Golden library check:** scanned all 19 bundled `skills/shortcuts-playground/golden-shortcuts/xml/*.xml` files — zero placeholder UUIDs, so the new rule doesn't regress anything in the bundled reference corpus.
- **End-to-end build test (B1):** `/shortcuts-playground:build` on a 6-action shortcut ("UUID Check" — Comment + Comment + Ask for Input → Set Variable → Text → Notification). Result: all 4 action UUIDs were real `uuidgen` random values (`AE254120-7DAC-48DD-A723-C5223C00641B`, `0C6669B3-51D1-42B0-986E-DB8E1AE871E1`, `8FC3AED1-BC6F-4A95-A020-40CAF87114FF`, `0FABF921-C030-4E32-96C1-10F9AE5B13FD`). Zero Craig Loop iterations — validator passed on first Write.
- **End-to-end remix test (B2):** `/shortcuts-playground:remix` on the B1 output, adding a second Show Notification. Result: all 4 original UUIDs preserved verbatim, exactly 1 new `uuidgen` UUID added for the new notification (`1D11A550-7EE1-446A-B2C1-91E35AE563A8`), icon preserved, `WFWorkflowName` renamed to "UUID Check Plus" as requested.
- **Legacy migration test (B3):** `/shortcuts-playground:remix` on `Rescheduler V14.xml` — a pre-v1.5.1 source containing 10 placeholder UUIDs (`11111111-…` through `AAAAAAAA-…`). Result: the remixer detected all 10 placeholders during step 6's audit, minted 11 replacement UUIDs via `uuidgen` (10 migrations + 1 new notification), applied the remap table across `UUID`, `OutputUUID`, and `GroupingIdentifier` occurrences consistently, and produced a clean signed output. Migrated draft has **zero** placeholder UUIDs (grep confirmed), **11 total** UUIDs (10 migrated source + 1 new), validator passed, `AEA1` magic confirmed on the signed file.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added — Remix workflow (new command + new agent)

You can now apply a natural-language diff to an existing unsigned `.xml` Shortcuts plist. This is the plugin port of a previously manual "remix mode" workflow driven from a companion Shortcuts shortcut.

**New slash command: `/shortcuts-playground:remix <absolute-path-to-xml> <remix idea>`.**

Point it at an absolute path to an unsigned `.xml` file plus a natural-language description of what to change. It delegates to a new `shortcut-remixer` agent that applies a **surgical diff**: existing UUIDs preserved, icon preserved, client-version metadata preserved, every action the user didn't ask to touch left verbatim.

**New agent: `agents/shortcut-remixer.md`.**

Mirrors the `shortcut-builder` agent on step 0 (resolve `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_OUTPUT_DIR` first) and step 11 (mandatory verify-before-report), but has its own workflow in between:

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into source path + remix idea. Look for an absolute path ending in `.xml` (quoted or unquoted, with spaces permitted). If no path found, escalate immediately — never guess, never grep.
2. Source validation: (a) file exists and is readable, (b) extension is `.xml` (NOT `.shortcut`), (c) first 4 bytes are NOT `AEA1`, (d) contains `WFWorkflowActions`. If any check fails, escalate with the specific reason.
3. Read the full source XML.
4. Run `validate-shortcut` on the source as a baseline. Pre-existing issues are informational — the remixer does NOT fix anything the user didn't ask to fix.
5. Read only the skill reference files needed for the specific diff (budget: 8 total Read/Grep/Glob calls).
6. Plan the diff: add / modify / remove, with UUIDs.
7. Determine the new shortcut name (explicit user rename, or `<source stem> Remix`).
8. Write a verbatim copy of the source to `<OUTPUT_DIR>/drafts/<new name>.xml` — this gives `Edit` stable anchors.
9. Apply the diff via `Edit` calls. Each `Edit` triggers the `PostToolUse` hook which re-runs the validator. Fix errors the remixer introduced; leave pre-existing errors alone unless they block signing.
10. Archive + sign via `sign-shortcut`.
11. Verify the signed file exists via `ls -la`, then report: signed path, archive path, source path, one-paragraph diff summary, and any caveats.

**The same `PostToolUse` auto-validate hook fires for both agents.** The hook's matcher is `Write|Edit` — it's agent-agnostic and tool-specific. Every `Write` and `Edit` the remixer performs on the draft XML triggers the validator automatically, just like the builder. Verified with an ephemeral trace during end-to-end testing (trace removed before commit).

### Preservation rules (hard-coded in the remixer system prompt)

- Never regenerate UUIDs for actions the user didn't explicitly ask to modify. Only new actions get new UUIDs.
- Never change `WFWorkflowIcon` — the source's icon is preserved. (The `resolve-icon` step is skipped for remixes.)
- Never change `WFWorkflowClientVersion`, `WFWorkflowMinimumClientVersion`, `WFWorkflowMinimumClientVersionString`, `WFWorkflowInputContentItemClasses`, `WFWorkflowOutputContentItemClasses`, or `WFWorkflowTypes`. The source is the source.
- Never rename (`WFWorkflowName`) unless the user explicitly asks for a new name.
- Never overwrite the source file. The remix writes to a new path under `<OUTPUT_DIR>/drafts/` with a new name (default `<source stem> Remix`).
- Never reformat unrelated XML. The diff is surgical, not a reflow.
- Never "clean up" pre-existing issues in the source that the user didn't mention.

### Escalation paths (verified end-to-end)

The remixer escalates to the orchestrator — which relays verbatim to the user — in these cases:

- **No source path in `$ARGUMENTS`.** The agent echoes the input verbatim and lists three options (re-run with a path prefix, export unsigned XML, or provide the display name). It does NOT search the filesystem. Verified T1.
- **Source is a signed `.shortcut` file** (detected via `.shortcut` extension or `AEA1` magic bytes). The agent asks the user to export unsigned XML instead. Verified T2.
- **Source doesn't exist, is unreadable, or isn't a Shortcuts plist** (missing `WFWorkflowActions`). The agent reports the specific reason.
- **Remix requires an undocumented parameter schema**, a ToolKit-only identifier, or a third-party action. Same escalation gates as the builder.

### Shortcuts → SSH integration

If you're driving the plugin from an iOS/iPadOS Shortcuts shortcut over SSH:

```bash
ssh user@example-mac.local \
  'CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_OUTPUT_DIR="$HOME/Documents/Shortcuts Playground" \
   claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions \
   "/shortcuts-playground:remix /absolute/path/to/source.xml [remix idea]"'
```

Same env-var pattern as `/build`. Pair with an "end your message with `SIGNED: <path>`" contract if you want the client-side Shortcut to grep the absolute path out of the response.

### Changed

- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/SKILL.md`**: top-of-file block updated to list both slash commands + both agents. Skill description string updated to include "REMIX" in the trigger keywords so auto-invocation catches remix intent too.
- **`README.md`**: "What's in the box" table now lists both agents and both slash commands. New "Remix an existing shortcut" section under Usage. Directory layout diagram reflects the new `agents/shortcut-remixer.md` and `commands/remix.md` files.

### Verified (test matrix, 4/4 green)

- **T1 — no-path escalation:** `/shortcuts-playground:remix add a Show Notification at the start` (no path in args). **Result:** agent immediately escalated with re-run instructions listing three options. Zero file reads, zero grep, zero hook invocations. Trace log empty — the agent performed no `Write`/`Edit` operations.
- **T2 — signed-file escalation:** `/shortcuts-playground:remix /Users/you/Documents/Shortcuts Playground/Rescheduler V14.shortcut add a notification at the start`. **Result:** agent detected the `.shortcut` extension / `AEA1` magic bytes, escalated asking the user to export unsigned XML first, and suggested the specific re-run path pattern. Trace log still empty — no hook invocations.
- **T3 — successful remix end-to-end:** `/shortcuts-playground:remix /Users/you/Documents/Shortcuts Playground/drafts/Rescheduler V14.xml add a Show Notification action at the very start… Name the remix Rescheduler V14 Notified.` **Result:**
  - Signed output at `~/Documents/Shortcuts Playground/Rescheduler V14 Notified.shortcut`, AEA1 magic confirmed.
  - Archive XML at `~/Documents/Shortcuts Playground/2026-04-14/Rescheduler V14 Notified-142753.xml`, validator-clean.
  - **All 10 source UUIDs preserved** (exact diff: no source UUIDs missing from the remix).
  - **Exactly 1 new UUID added** for the new notification action.
  - **Icon preserved**: glyph `61464`, start color `3031607807` (unchanged byte-for-byte).
  - **`WFWorkflowName` updated to "Rescheduler V14 Notified"** per the user's explicit rename.
  - **Leading Comment block**: index 0 contains the remix description ("Rescheduler V14 Notified — Remixed from Rescheduler V14. Added a Show Notification action at the very start…"), index 1 contains the disclaimer with "Remixed via /shortcuts-playground:remix." suffix. Source's original description Comment preserved at index 3 verbatim.
  - **New notification action** inserted at index 2 (first executable position after the leading Comments). Source's own trailing confirmation notification (unrelated to the new one) preserved at the tail.
  - **Action count**: 16 (source) → 17 (remix), +1 new action.
- **T4 — hook fires during remix:** ephemeral trace added to `hooks/auto-validate.sh` during the T3 test run. **Result:** hook fired 5 times across the remix flow (1 initial `Write` of the verbatim source copy + 4 subsequent `Edit` calls for the comment updates, name update, and notification insertion). Each invocation logged the correct absolute path of the draft file. Trace reverted before commit — `hooks/auto-validate.sh` is now back to its pre-test state.

### Known issue flagged (not a v1.5.0 regression)

- **Placeholder UUIDs.** Both `shortcut-builder` and `shortcut-remixer` are producing sequential-placeholder UUIDs (`11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`, `22222222-…`, etc.) instead of `uuidgen`-random values. This was already present in the v1.4.0 `Rescheduler V14.xml` build output — the remixer in this release just preserved the existing pattern. Functionally valid (unique within each file, correct format, uppercase), but not ideal for long-term uniqueness across multiple shortcuts in the same library. Fix will land as a follow-up patch by tightening the UUID-generation rule in both agent system prompts to require `uuidgen` output rather than placeholder sequences.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-04-14

### Added (docs-only patch, verified against a second Apple-built sample)

An exported shortcut sample provided coverage for the `Is Completed` filter in both its Find and Filter forms. Two new patterns landed in the docs as a result:

- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/FILTERS.md`** — expanded the Reminders Boolean filter section with verbatim templates for `Is Completed = Yes` and `Is Completed = No`. Documented the key distinction that **Reminders Boolean filters do NOT need `Unit: 4`** — that's a Photos-filter requirement and does not apply to Reminders. Added a new top-level section **"Find vs Filter: `WFContentItemInputParameter`"** explaining that `is.workflow.actions.filter.<type>` covers both UI variants; the presence of `WFContentItemInputParameter` (wrapping a previous action's `ActionOutput`) turns a "Find" into a chained "Filter" that operates on upstream output instead of the system database. Applies uniformly to `filter.photos`, `filter.files`, `filter.notes`, `filter.calendarevents`, etc. — not just Reminders.
- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/PARAMETER_TYPES.md`** — added a cross-reference from the Reminders schema section to the new FILTERS.md Is-Completed template and Find-vs-Filter section. Flags the "Reminders drop `Unit`, Photos require it" Boolean divergence.

No code, validator, agent, or command changes in this patch — it's pure documentation closing the gap that the v1.4.0 Rescheduler build exposed (the agent correctly refused to guess a Boolean filter schema for Is Completed because it wasn't documented).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed — all the blockers surfaced by session 5174fcb1

A real "Rescheduler" build exposed five distinct problems:

1. **Docs gap on Reminders schema.** The `is.workflow.actions.setters.reminders` action was allowlisted but had no documented parameter schema. The first subagent escalated per the v1.2.0 rule; the main thread then spent 20+ tool calls rediscovering the schema by grepping user paths.
2. **Agent went down the `UpdateReminderAppIntent` dead end first.** The docs didn't tell it to prefer the classic WF action over the newer AppIntent.
3. **Draft/output split.** The agent wrote the draft to `~/Documents/Shortcuts Playground/drafts/` (the hardcoded fallback) instead of resolving `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_OUTPUT_DIR` to the user-configured output directory. The signed file then landed in the correct dir (because `sign-shortcut` resolves the env var at shell level), but the draft was orphaned elsewhere.
4. **Subagent stopped after drafting.** It finished validate → fix → revalidate, but never called `sign-shortcut`. The main thread had to sign manually.
5. **Main thread did open-ended research.** When the subagent escalated, the main thread grepped `~/Documents/Shortcuts Playground`, `~/Agent`, `~/.claude/skills/shortcuts-playground` (deleted), and the plugin dir — wandering into user paths that shouldn't have been in scope.

### Added — Reminders recipes verified against an Apple-built sample

A second sample shortcut (`Reminder Edits.xml`) exercises `filter.reminders` with date operators plus `setters.reminders` applied to 13 different property names. That sample is now the ground truth. New content:

- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/PARAMETER_TYPES.md` → new section "Reminders — Filter & Setter Schemas (DEFINITIVE)"**
  - Full `filter.reminders` template structure (`Operator`/`Property`/`Values`, distinguished from If conditional templates).
  - Date operator codes: `1002` ("is today", empty `Values`), `1003` ("is between", `Values.Date` literal + `Values.AnotherDate` token attachment). Explicitly flags the difference from If conditional `1003` (which uses `WFNumberValue`/`WFAnotherNumber`).
  - Full `setters.reminders` template with `Mode`, `UUID`, `WFContentItemPropertyName`, chained `WFInput`, and the verified per-property value-key table: Due Date, Title, Parent Reminder, Subtasks, URL, Notes, Tags, When Messaging Person, Images, Priority, Is Completed, Is Flagged, List. Notes that `List` is the only property taking a plain string (not a token attachment).
  - Verbatim templates for single-property set, chained multi-property set, and the common "reschedule" pattern from a date-picker variable.
  - Anti-pattern list: never use `UpdateReminderAppIntent`, never chain setters without `WFInput`, never wrap `WFReminderContentItemList` in a token attachment, never conflate filter `1003` with If conditional `1003`.

- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/FILTERS.md` — new "Is Between Date Filter" template** with the `Values.Date` + `Values.AnotherDate` structure, plus a verbatim Reminders-specific multi-row filter example.

- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/APPINTENTS.md`** — leading warning on the Reminders section explicitly directing builds away from `UpdateReminderAppIntent` and toward the documented `is.workflow.actions.setters.reminders` path.

- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/SKILL.md` new rule 56** — summarizes the Reminders-always-use-setters rule and the filter date operator codes, with a pointer to the PARAMETER_TYPES.md section.

### Changed — agent behavior hardening

**`agents/shortcut-builder.md`:**
- **New step 0: "Resolve the output directory FIRST."** The agent must run a Bash command to echo the resolved absolute path from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_OUTPUT_DIR:-$HOME/Documents/Shortcuts Playground}` before doing anything else, then use that literal path for every subsequent Write/Edit/Bash call. Eliminates the draft-path split bug.
- **New step 10: "Verify + report (MANDATORY)."** The agent is not done until `ls -la "<OUTPUT_DIR>/<name>.shortcut"` succeeds with non-zero file size. "Validation passed" alone is not a valid terminal state — the agent must sign and verify before declaring the build complete.
- **Explicit allowed-search-paths rule.** The agent may Grep/Glob/Read only inside `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and the specific file being written inside `<OUTPUT_DIR>`. Every other path — `~/Documents` broadly, `~/Agent`, `~/.claude`, `~/Library`, `/Applications`, `/System` — is off limits. If the answer isn't in the plugin directory, escalate to the user per the validation gates; do not go hunting.

**`commands/build.md`:**
- **Orchestrator research scope rule.** When the subagent escalates, the main thread may read only the plugin directory and the specific draft file the agent just wrote. It may NOT grep `~/Documents` broadly, `~/Agent`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/plugins`, `~/.claude/projects`, `~/Library`, `/Applications`, or `/System`. If the plugin directory doesn't have the answer, the main thread relays the escalation to the user verbatim instead of improvising.
- **No archive mining.** The plugin's output directory contains user-generated content, not curated examples. It may include dead ends, deprecated patterns, or quality issues. The canonical reference is the plugin directory itself. If a reference corpus is ever needed, it will be an explicit opt-in `reference/` subdirectory, not implicit archive mining.
- **No binary inspection of signed shortcuts.** Signed files are Apple Encrypted Archives (`AEA1`); they can't be read as plaintext plists via `plutil`/`xxd`/`file`. If you need to see the structure, read the unsigned XML in the drafts folder instead.

### Verified

- `shortcuts-playground-selftest` passes.
- `claude plugin validate` passes on both plugin.json and the dev marketplace.json.
- The Apple-built `Reminder Edits` sample produces **zero filter/setter schema errors** — only the expected convention-only errors (missing Comment blocks, unused input content classes).
- `sign-shortcut --output-dir` flag correctly wins over `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_OUTPUT_DIR` env var: flag writes to the flag path, env-var path stays empty. Both produce signed files with `AEA1` magic bytes.
- `PostToolUse` auto-validate hook fires on every Write that produces a Shortcuts plist; verified via an ephemeral trace log in a fresh headless session (trace removed before commit).
- The Rescheduler prompt from session 5174fcb1 — re-run on v1.4.0 — [see test matrix below].

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed (factually wrong conditional documentation)

The previous condition code documentation had multiple errors that propagated into both the validator and the agent's authoring instructions. Verified against an Apple-built sample shortcut covering every condition code and the multi-condition pattern. Specific corrections:

- **Codes 0/1/3 had wrong UI labels.** Old docs said `0 = Equals`, `1 = Does Not Equal`, `3 = Is Less Than`. Ground truth: `0 = is less than`, `1 = is less than or equal to`, `3 = is greater than or equal to`. Code `2` was already correct (`is greater than`). There is no numeric "equals" code in the modern conditional action.
- **The "implicit input for numeric conditions" rule was wrong.** Every conditional in the Apple sample — numeric, string, and existence — sets an explicit `WFInput` as a `Type=Variable` wrapper. The previous claim that codes 0–3 use implicit input and that "the validator has a gap" was the actual bug.
- **Code `1003` (`is between`) was undocumented.** Now documented: requires both `WFNumberValue` (lower bound, literal) and `WFAnotherNumber` (upper bound, token attachment that can hold a literal or a variable).
- **Multi-condition If (`Any are true` / `All are true`) was forbidden as "compound conditionals not supported".** Apple's modern Shortcuts uses them and so should generated shortcuts. Now fully documented in CONTROL_FLOW.md as the `WFConditions` + `WFContentPredicateTableTemplate` pattern with `WFActionParameterFilterPrefix` (`0` = Any, `1` = All) and `WFActionParameterFilterTemplates` array of per-row condition templates.

### Validator changes (`scripts/validate_shortcut.py`)

- `STRING_CONDITION_CODES` expanded from `{4, 99}` to `{4, 5, 8, 9, 99, 999}`.
- `NUMBER_CONDITION_CODES` expanded from `{2}` to `{0, 1, 2, 3, 1003}`.
- New `EXISTENCE_CONDITION_CODES = {100, 101}` — codes that take only `WFInput` and reject both `WFConditionalActionString` and `WFNumberValue`.
- New `ALL_CONDITION_CODES` aggregate; the validator now rejects unknown codes outright.
- `if not cond` truthiness check replaced with `if cond is None` (Python's `not 0` was treating valid code 0 as missing — the actual root cause behind the "validator gap" item that the old docs warned about).
- Multi-condition Ifs (`WFConditions`) are now a recognized pattern instead of an error. The validator checks: (a) `WFSerializationType` must be `WFContentPredicateTableTemplate`, (b) `WFActionParameterFilterPrefix` must be `0` (Any) or `1` (All), (c) `WFActionParameterFilterTemplates` must be a non-empty list, (d) each template has its own `WFCondition` + `WFInput` + appropriate literal field, (e) the action does NOT also set top-level `WFCondition` / `WFInput` (mutually exclusive with `WFConditions`).
- Per-code validation now enforces: code 1003 needs `WFAnotherNumber`; existence codes 100/101 must NOT set literal fields; all codes uniformly require explicit `WFInput` as a `Type=Variable` wrapper.

### Documentation changes

- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/CONTROL_FLOW.md`** — entire conditional section rewritten. New definitive code table (13 codes including 1003), uniform `WFInput` rule, `is between` template, full multi-condition If template with rules for each row inside `WFActionParameterFilterTemplates`. Anti-pattern list updated to flag mixing single-condition and multi-condition fields.
- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/BEST_PRACTICES.md`** — conditional bullet rewritten with the corrected code table and the `Type=Variable` wrapper requirement. Removed the "implicit input" advice. The "Known Validator Gaps" section had its conditional entries removed; both the code-0 truthiness bug and the implicit-input gap were fixed in this release.
- **`skills/shortcuts-playground/SKILL.md` rule #17** — replaced with the corrected uniform-input rule and pointer to CONTROL_FLOW.md.

### Verified

- The Apple sample (`Conditionals.xml`, 41 actions covering codes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 99, 100, 101, 999, 1003, plus a multi-condition Any-of-three block) now validates with **zero conditional errors**. Remaining errors against the sample are convention-only (missing leading Comment blocks, unused `WFWorkflowInputContentItemClasses`) and correctly enforced for shortcuts the plugin generates.
- `shortcuts-playground-selftest` still passes all six sub-checks.
- Hello World regression still produces a signed `.shortcut`.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed (important behavior)
- **Agent reconnaissance failure mode.** The `shortcut-builder` agent could go into unbounded exploration when an action identifier was allowlisted but lacked a documented parameter schema — it would query the user's local `~/Library/Shortcuts/Shortcuts.sqlite`, the ToolKit database, Google Drive backups, and system binaries looking for examples. Reproduced with the prompt *"Build a shortcut that gets my reminders due today and lets me select multiple ones to reschedule them"* against `is.workflow.actions.setters.reminders`. The agent now stops and escalates to the user with three clean options (best-effort guess, simpler alternative, user-provided example) and never touches local databases during authoring.

### Removed
- **All references to `Shortcuts.sqlite` / `ZSHORTCUTACTIONS` / ToolKit sqlite from user-facing skill docs.** Purged from `SKILL.md` (rule #54 rewritten), `PARAMETER_TYPES.md` (verification section replaced with character ordinal table), `BEST_PRACTICES.md` (batch install verification bullet), `TOOLKIT_SNAPSHOT.md` (rewritten), and the skill's internal `README.md` (installed-batch-verification section deleted).
- **`scripts/install_and_verify_shortcuts.py`** — deleted. The script was only referenced from the now-removed docs.
- **Optional local ToolKit sqlite expansion in `validate_shortcut.py`** — removed. The bundled `data/toolkit-v63-tool-ids.json` (1,794 identifiers) is now the only allowlist source, making the validator deterministic and sqlite-free.
- **`import sqlite3`** — no longer present anywhere in the plugin's runtime code.

### Added (agent system prompt)
- **Hard rules against reconnaissance** in `agents/shortcut-builder.md`:
  - Never inspect `~/Library/Shortcuts/Shortcuts.sqlite` for authoring discovery (post-runtime debugging use is also removed from the docs entirely).
  - Never inspect `~/Library/Shortcuts/ToolKit/*.sqlite` or any ToolKit database.
  - Never search `~/Library/CloudStorage`, `~/Library/Mobile Documents`, `/System/Applications/Shortcuts.app`, or `/Applications/Shortcuts.app` for template shortcuts.
  - Never write inline Python that imports `sqlite3` or `objc`.
  - When an allowlisted action has no documented parameter schema, **stop and ask the user** with three concrete options.
- **Bounded research budget** — the agent may use up to 8 total Read/Grep/Glob calls before authoring or escalating. Prevents the unbounded-exploration failure mode even when no single rule fires.

### Changed
- **Rule #54 in `SKILL.md`** rewritten from "Verify installed shortcut behavior against Shortcuts.sqlite" to "Never inspect the user's local system for authoring discovery" — the old rule was the specific trigger that the agent was misapplying.
- **`TOOLKIT_SNAPSHOT.md`** retitled and rewritten to remove the "to avoid extracting ToolKit sqlite" framing. The snapshot just exists; no sqlite backstory.

### Verified
- Self-test passes.
- Hello World regression produces signed `.shortcut`.
- The exact failing reminders prompt now triggers the escalation path: the agent stops, presents three options, makes zero tool calls to Shortcuts.sqlite / ToolKit / Google Drive / system paths.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- `bin/shortcuts-playground-selftest` — post-install smoke test that verifies Python 3.10+, the macOS `shortcuts` CLI, plugin root resolution, bundled data files, a validator pass on an embedded golden XML, and a full `sign-shortcut` archive + sign round trip to a temp dir. Exits with specific error messages on any failure. Supports `SHORTCUTS_PLAYGROUND_SELFTEST_SKIP_SIGN=1` for CI environments without the `shortcuts` CLI.
- `commands/build.md` — `/shortcuts-playground:build <brief>` slash command. Explicit entry point that delegates to the `shortcut-builder` agent with the brief as `$ARGUMENTS`. Complements natural-language auto-invocation.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — single-plugin marketplace manifest so the plugin directory can be added via `claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/shortcuts-playground-plugin`.

### Changed
- **README.md** — rewrote the Requirements section to clearly state the Python 3.10+ requirement (`/usr/bin/python3` on older macOS is 3.9.6 and will fail). Added a Health Check section that walks readers through post-install verification in four commands. Added a Configuration section documenting the three ways to set `userConfig` values: interactive `/plugin` TUI, manual `settings.json` edit under `pluginConfigs`, or direct `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` env var override. Added a Development section explaining the directory-vs-git marketplace cache behavior (directory installs read from source; git installs read from cache and require `claude plugin update`). Added the slash command to the Usage section.
- **Plugin version bumped from 1.0.0 → 1.1.0** (minor — additive features, no breaking changes).

### Verified
- Full test matrix on v1.1.0 (8 checks, all green):
  - T1: `claude plugin validate` on plugin.json and marketplace.json.
  - T2: `shortcuts-playground-selftest` from plugin root — all 6 sub-checks pass.
  - T3: `shortcuts-playground-selftest` from `/tmp` without `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` — fallback path resolution works.
  - T4: negative self-test (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=/tmp/nonexistent`) exits 1 with 6 specific error messages.
  - T5: `/shortcuts-playground:build` slash command via headless `claude -p` produces a signed `.shortcut`.
  - T6: natural-language auto-invocation (no slash command) produces a signed `.shortcut`.
  - T7: validator hook blocks a write with an unknown action identifier in headless mode.
  - T8: re-validation of every archive XML produced in the matrix — all pass.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- Initial plugin conversion from the standalone `generate-shortcuts-skill` Claude Code skill.
- `skills/shortcuts-playground/` — full knowledge base carried over verbatim, with `SKILL.md` adapted to invoke the new bin wrappers instead of `python3 scripts/*.py` calls. Includes `BEST_PRACTICES.md`, `ACTIONS.md`, `APPINTENTS.md`, `PARAMETER_TYPES.md`, `VARIABLES.md`, `CONTROL_FLOW.md`, `FILTERS.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_ACTIONS.md`, `TOOLKIT_SNAPSHOT.md`, `ICONS_AND_COLORS.md`, `PLIST_FORMAT.md`, the golden-shortcuts reference library, and the ToolKit v63 metadata bundle.
- `agents/shortcut-builder.md` — specialized agent that owns the full design → build → validate → sign → archive loop, keeping the main thread free of the 1.2 MB knowledge base.
- `hooks/hooks.json` + `hooks/auto-validate.sh` — `PostToolUse` hook that auto-runs the Craig Loop validator on every `Write`/`Edit` that produces a Shortcuts plist file. Exits with code 2 + stderr on failure so validator output is injected back into Claude's context for the next iteration.
- `bin/validate-shortcut` — wrapper around `validate_shortcut.py`.
- `bin/resolve-icon` — wrapper around `select_shortcut_icon_color.py`.
- `bin/sign-shortcut` — combines archive + `shortcuts sign` into one command; respects `output_dir` and `signing_mode` userConfig values.
- `userConfig.output_dir` and `userConfig.signing_mode` — prompted at install time; falls back to `~/Documents/Shortcuts Playground` and `anyone` respectively.

### Migration notes from the standalone skill
- The Craig Loop is now **automatic**. Previously the model had to remember to invoke `validate_shortcut.py` after every `Write`; now the hook runs it unconditionally.
- All paths in `SKILL.md` that referenced `python3 scripts/<name>.py` now use the bin wrappers (`validate-shortcut`, `resolve-icon`, `sign-shortcut`) or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`-prefixed paths for the dev-only regression scripts.
- The archive directory is configurable via `userConfig.output_dir` instead of the hardcoded `~/Agent/Shortcuts Playground/` path.
- The skill name namespace is now `shortcuts-playground:shortcuts-playground`; the original `shortcuts-generator` name remains available via the parallel `~/.claude/skills/generate-shortcuts-skill/` installation until it is explicitly removed.
